# Shahafster (-002)

### Status: In Progress

#### Welcome to [Shahafster](), my personal blog.
Here, you would be able to keep up with various updates of my life:, Workouts, Social LIfe, Projects, Work, and much more.

In Shahafster-002, you now have the ability to make your own account to the site. If your identity has been verified (by myself, of course),
you would be able to see private content from my life that I will upload to this site.

If you're curious to learn about the architechture of the site and the development process, here is the summary.
I designed and coded everything by myself first in 2020, but took down to the site due to privacy concerns, hence the features added in shahafster-002.

1. The manager (myself) will update the blog site of some information.
2. Upon a JavaScript event, the backend PHP code will process the request and properly update the server.
3. The server will send the proper information updates to the private SQL database
4. Once all updates have registared successfully in the database, the new updated information to display is requested by the server.
5. The server send the updated information to the backend PHP code to process.
